# Module-18-Social-Network-API

## Description:


The NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API is a robust API designed for a social networking web application. Utilizing MongoDB as its database, the API is built on Express.js for routing and Mongoose as the ODM. With features for users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage friend lists, the API ensures efficient handling of unstructured data. Through server initialization, formatted JSON responses, and successful CRUD operations tested with Insomnia, developers demonstrate proficiency in API development.
